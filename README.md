# Set Home

### Introduction
This plugin allows players to set multiple homes across the Minecraft world and teleport to them with a click of a button.

Additionally, server admins have the ability to blacklist certain dimensions, restricting the ability to set a home in those dimensions.

If a home has already been created in a certain dimension and it gets blacklisted later, the player will still see the home in their inventory, but will not be able to teleport to it. 

### Commands
- `/create-home [name] [display_material | d | default] [description]` (creates a home)
- `/delete-home [name]` (deletes a home)
- `/add-to-blacklist [dimension names]` (adds a dimension to the blacklist table)
- `/remove-from-blacklist [dimension names]` (removes a dimension from the blacklist table)
- `/get-blacklisted-dimensions` (retrieve all dimensions that are on blacklist table)

### Extra Features
- The time it takes to teleport to a saved home can be configured
- Players can choose which Minecraft item they would like to use as an icon for their saved homes (each home can use a different Minecraft item)
- Server admins can configure what the default item is for saved home's icon
